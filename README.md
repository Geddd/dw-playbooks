```yaml

layout: entry
permalink: /the-dw-class
link: http://www.thedwclass.world
author: ['Jane Doe', 'John Smith']
source: The DW Supplement
source-url: http://thedungeon.world/supplement

excerpt: Put the description of your playbook here. Keep it short; no more than 200 characters will display.

categories:
- category (use archetype or categories from similar playbooks already entered)

tags:
- commercial or free
- license (if not commercial)
- pwyw (if it is)
- setting (if there is one)
- pack (if there is one)
- anything else you think relevant

---

  Any content you want shown on the individual entry page should go here. If you don't use an explicit excerpt field above, one will be generated here, using the first 200 characters.

```

Note: Please put direct quotes from a product page in quotes; surround quoted material with quotes and replace apostrophes with ```&apos;```. Otherwise use your own words. Thanks.

```yaml
excerpt: '"This is a direct quote; it isn&apos;t my own words."'
```
