message: "I am still at the early levels of a paladin character. Of the two core starting moves, Lay On Hands is poorly written. It's very high risk for the paladin to use and immeadetly needs the table to define 'ally' and wether the Paladin can use it on themselves. The as-written limitation of Human and Good were ignored at the table, but the bonus were from these were not changed. \r\n\r\nThat said, the quest and quest bonuses seem to work smoothly, although I have deliberatly chosen a quest that will never be completed (for simplicity). The party has latched onto my god as a worldbuilding hook."
