  This class brings a new style of gameplay to the base classes of dungeon world
  system; rather than straight up combat, or spells, or boons, you can
  micro-manage a select few corpses that you gather. Most of the advanced moves
  concern new ways in which you can control your minions and what you can turn
  into minions, making things stronger, combining them for benefits, or even
  making them into full time assistants. If you choose to play with this class
  them you should expect to handle with gore and ick a fair bit, and the class
  sheet tries to sway you towards playing 'evil' characters but with a decent GM
  and a little creativity this is easily rectified. The abilities are well
  balanced in my opinion and very fun. Fully recommend this class for anyone
  interested in a different play style and doesn't mind the horror.
