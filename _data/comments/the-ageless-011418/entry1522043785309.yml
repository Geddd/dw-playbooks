  The ageless with its multiple archetypes hits the sweet spot for me as a great
  class for playing the immortal.  The eternal knight, the shadow over time, the
  historian,  the grand spell caster. All have an epic feel to them while not
  being extremely difficult to work into any party, and easy for a gm to create
  complications for.
