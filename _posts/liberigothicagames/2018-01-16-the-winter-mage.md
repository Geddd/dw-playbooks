The Winter Mage is as hard as ice, as biting as the wind, and as distant as the snowy mountaintops. With your Chill stat, you have a second pool of hit points to draw from, equal to your full Constitution score. You can spend it to reduce damage, but you can also use it to freeze things in their place, coat them in frozen armor, or make a castle of ice to live in.
