You ached to see the light of day again. They wouldn’t put dogs in some of the places you’ve been kept. Sure, you did some bad things, but you had bad things done to you too. Maybe it was a frame job, who knows? Everyone expected you to die in the hole. The thing is, you’re a survivor. You learned from your scars and adapted. You became a cunning, wild animal when necessary, cold and calculating when it suited. And no matter what, you’re never going back ... not alive, anyway.
