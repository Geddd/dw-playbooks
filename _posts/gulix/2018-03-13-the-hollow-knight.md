excerpt: Play as an animated suit of armor, abandoned centuries ago by its Creator in the aftermath of the Divine War. Would you like to come back into favour with Him, or do you just want to get the rest you deserve? Unless your goal is to discover new places ? You already walk through all the known lands, but places and people are changing. Find out about these changes as you travel.

Perhaps you value your martial superiority, acquired throughout the years spent selling your services. Protect your allies and develop your military leadership skills. Many are willing to acquire the services of a Divine War Veteran.

Speak on behalf of the Valley and the other Hollow Knights. Be their Emissary! Your nation has a special place on the political and commercial chessboard, and your people are anachronistic. How do other countries see you? Will you proudly wear your colours?

In this character playbook for Dungeon World, you will find a way to experience the adventures of a Hollow Knight, an armor endowed with a spirit, blocked in this world for centuries and abandoned by its Divine Creator. Use Moves specific to this playbook, which borrows from others such as the Paladin, the Wayfarer or the Defender. Answer questions provided to help you integrate this type of character into a Session Zero. And discover the Design Notes that will help you understand the choices I've made.
