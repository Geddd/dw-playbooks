description: ""The Medic is a playbook for the Dungeon World roleplaying game. She is a healer who ensures the party survives the most dangerous of circumstances. She can play as a pacifist, protecting the party as much as she can without killing, or she can be a mad doctor, using her medical knowledge to ensure every blow is deadly.""
