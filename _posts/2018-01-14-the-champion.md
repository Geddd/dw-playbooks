The gods chose you, whether you wanted to be chosen or not, to be their voice in the mortal realm. Nevermind that you were
on your way to becoming something else. They have bestowed upon you powers beyond imagining. With a single word, you can transform into an avatar of your god’s will. You can soar through the sky, shrug off blows that would kill a mortal man, and more. You are more than just a hero. No, that word no longer describes you.

You are a superhero.
