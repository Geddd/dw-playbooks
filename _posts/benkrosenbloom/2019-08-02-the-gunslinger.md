The Gunslinger wields guns with the intent to shoot people. Unfortunately for them, there are other people with similar ideas. This version of the Gunslinger doesn't totally eschew the power fantasy of holding a gun and shooting it at bad guys, but one of the goals of this playbook is to insert at least a few questions along the way. The Gunslinger has some degree of fiat over who else in the story wields a gun - but as their story goes on and they are drawn into and become a part of the world's problems, they might find themselves hurtling towards a showdown at sundown.
