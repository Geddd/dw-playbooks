The Summoner can conjure entities from other planes to do their bidding. The summoned creature is treated as a temporary character, distinguishing the Summoner from other pet-classes, like the Ranger, and giving them a good deal of versatility.  The Summoner also has a variety of other planar abilities to round out its kit and progression.
