The Sorcerer is an unstoppable font of magic. Using their unique magical soul, Sorcerers can create spells on the fly - but using that power unchecked can lead to disastrous consequences. Inspired by D&D's eponymous spontaneous caster, but mechanically owes more to the Nova from Brendon Conway's game Masks and to Mage: the Awakening, by White Wolf.
