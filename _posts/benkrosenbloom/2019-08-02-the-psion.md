The Psion wields both telekinesis and telepathy to frustrate their enemies and uncover hidden secrets as they unlock the power of their mind. The Psion draws inspiration from classic dnd psionics without needing to get bogged down in distinctions between magic and psionics or other other rules minutiae.
