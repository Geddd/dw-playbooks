The Verdant commands the power of life itself. Through their hands, plants grow, wounds knit themselves closed, and creatures grow and change. The Verdant is an inversion of a sort of the Immolator. At their touch, life flourishes. Where destruction reigned, creation returns. The Verdant is a potent healer and support playbook, with a wide range of utility through the plants they grow.
