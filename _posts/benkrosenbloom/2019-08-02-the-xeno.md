A playbook for exploring alternatives to human/oid stereotypes, fighting oppression and intolerance, and remembering weird player level adjustments for monsters in d&d. Play as a monster, alien, or true stranger in a land that doesn't know what to do with you. An exploration of what it would mean to be other than human, the appeal of that, and who might already feel like that. Made for the mini monster jam on itch.io
