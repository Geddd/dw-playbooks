The Turncloak has betrayed their evil original cause, and now fights for revenge. What might be even more difficult is convincing the team that they've really switched sides. Playing as the Turncloak gives you a few knobs to turn when building the world or the perfect playbook for when you die but your party rescued a goblin who's ready for the limelight. In addition to moves from their villainous background, the Turncloak experiments with bonds, turning them into weapons against the enemy, or faultlines across which your party might shatter.
