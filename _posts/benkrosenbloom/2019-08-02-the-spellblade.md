The Spellblade gets to use both spells and blades (unfair if you ask me), and is determined to leave a lasting legacy. They might need to learn how to share the spotlight, first. The Spellblade is a powerful combatant who can exert narrative control over battles through their potent combination of swordplay and spellcasting. Perfect for players who are already great at sharing the spotlight or have trouble giving it up - the Spellblade plays with notions of classical heroism, the true nature of power, and who gets to be a/the protagonist
