Though the class is initially intended as a ranged damage-dealer (a number of moves give you bonus damage, add or let you swap out tags, or let you blow your entire load in one big attack), plenty of moves let you bleed into more of a supporting role: you can give your allies bonus armor against ranged attacks, provide covering fire, lead the way on a perilous journey, keep watch while everyone else rests, and so on.
